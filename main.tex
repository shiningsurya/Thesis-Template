\Abstract{%
	The VLITE (VLA Low Band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment; http://vlite.nrao.edu) program performs commensal observations using 16 antennas of the Very Large Array radio telescope from 320-384 MHz. The VLITE-Fast program searches for short time-scale (<1s) transients in real time and triggers recording of baseband voltages for offline imaging. Searches are made possible by a 12 node cluster, each housing GPUs for digital signal processing. A real-time MPI-based coadder incoherently sums the data streams from all the antennas and the coadded stream is fed to Heimdall for dedispersion and transient searching. This search yields many candidates, most of which are not astrophysical in nature. In order to respond swiftly and correctly to interesting transients, and to keep data rates manageable, candidates are classified with a convolutional neural network.  This work presents results from more than 64 days of observations, during which many single pulses from pulsars have been captured. The deep learning approach to classification proves particularly powerful in identifying such pulses. The continuing mission of this pipeline to be on sky as much as possible and detect all types of transients.
