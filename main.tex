\Abstract{%
	The VLITE (VLA Low Band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment; http://vlite.nrao.edu) program performs commensal observations using 16 antennas of the Very Large Array radio telescope from 320--384 MHz. The VLITE-Fast program searches for short time-scale (<100ms) transients, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), in real time and triggers recording of baseband voltages for offline imaging. Searches are made possible by a 12 node cluster, each housing GPUs for digital signal processing. A real-time Message Passing Interface (MPI)-based co-adder incoherently sums the data streams from all the antennas to boost the signal-to-noise. To undo the dispersion effects of signal propagation through the ionized interstellar medium, the co-added stream is de-dispersed and matched-filtered to search for transients. This operation is completely performed on GPUs by the software package Heimdall . A selection logic is applied to the candidates and interesting candidates with their corresponding data are processed and packaged in a binary file along with a diagnostic plot. Furthermore, a Machine Learning classification is developed and applied on the reduced data product and, based on its decision, baseband voltages are recorded.  Reduced data products collected over 126 days of on-sky operation form the VLITE-Fast Pathfinder Survey (VFPS). This pipeline has triggered on single pulses from 7 known radio pulsars. Lastly, the pipeline capabilities are tested against pure random noise and simulated injected signals.
